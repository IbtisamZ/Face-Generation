# Face Generation

## Udacity DLND

### Project Overview

In this project, We'll define and train a DCGAN on a dataset of faces. The goal is to get a generator network to generate new images of faces that look as realistic as possible!
We'll be using the [CelebFaces Attributes Dataset (CelebA)](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html) to train the adversarial networks.
